# AH Tweaks

### Current Features:
**Better Punching:**
Adds a configurable list of block tags to make certain blocks unbreakable without correct tool or even damage the player. (Similar to how No Tree Punching used to work back in 1.12.2)

You can use this mod for whatever you like :)
Any feedback is greatly appreciated
If there is interest I will make certain features of this mod into separate mods
